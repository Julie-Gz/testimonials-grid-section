## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I started with a mobile first approach. I set the display in the body element to flex in order to center the main element. The images were resized to 60px x 60px and the border radius was set 50% to make it a circle. The font sizes and the font weights were also changed to fit the screen size (360px). Throughtout the process I used the rem unit and percentages to allow the elements to adjust to the screens on which they are displayed.
In the desktop design I used grid areas to place the cards, and flexbox to align the contents in their containers. The fonts and images were also adjusted to adapt to larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
