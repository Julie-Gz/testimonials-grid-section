## My process
I started with a mobile first approach. I set the display in the body element to flex in order to center the main element. The images were resized to 60px x 60px and the border radius was set 50% to make it a circle. The font sizes and the font weights were also changed to fit the screen size (360px). Throughtout the process I used the rem unit and percentages to allow the elements to adjust to the screens on which they are displayed.
In the desktop design I used grid areas to place the cards, and flexbox to align the contents in their containers. The fonts and images were also adjusted to adapt to larger screens.
